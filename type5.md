# COUNT NUMBER OF OCURRENCES(or frequency) IN A SORTED ARRAY :-

# Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time complexity is O(Logn)

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,}, x = 2

Output: 4 
> x (or 2) occurs 4 times in arr[]

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,},   x = 3

Output: 1 

```cpp

// Find last occurence and first occurence of element

// Count = lastOccurence - firstOccurence + 1;

```
