# Order Agnostic Binary Search :- 

# Given a sorted array of numbers, find if a given number ‘key’ is present in the array. Though we know that the array is sorted, we don’t know if it’s sorted in ascending or descending order. . 

```cpp

// If array has only one element then compare by it.

// If array has more than one element then check 

// 1. arr[0] < arr[1] then ascending order
// 2. arr[0] > arr[1] then descending order

```
